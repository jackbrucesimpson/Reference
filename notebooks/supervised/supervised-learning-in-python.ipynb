The features need to be in an array where each column is a feature and each row a different observation or data point - in this case, a Congressman's voting record. The target needs to be a single column with the same number of observations as the feature data. We have done this for you in this exercise. Notice we named the feature array X and response variable y: This is in accordance with the common scikit-learn practice.\n",

In the following exercises, you'll be working with the MNIST digits recognition dataset, which has 10 classes, the digits 0 through 9!

Recall that scikit-learn's built-in datasets are of type Bunch, which are dictionary-like objects. Helpfully for the MNIST dataset, scikit-learn provides an 'images' key in addition to the 'data' and 'target' keys that you have seen with the Iris data. Because it is a 2D array of the images corresponding to each sample, this 'images' key is useful for visualizing the images, as you'll see in this exercise (for more on plotting 2D arrays, see Chapter 2 of DataCamp's course on Data Visualization with Python). On the other hand, the 'data' key contains the feature array - that is, the images as a flattened array of 64 pixels.\n",

You've seen three classifiers in this course so far: k-NN, logistic regression, and the decision tree. You will now be introduced to a fourth one - the Support Vector Machine, or SVM. For now, do not worry about how it works under the hood. It works exactly as you would expect of the scikit-learn estimators that you have worked with previously, in that it has the same .fit() and .predict() methods as before."
