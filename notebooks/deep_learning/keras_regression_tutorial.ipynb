    "The problem that we will look at in this tutorial is the Boston house price dataset. The dataset describes 13 numerical properties of houses in Boston suburbs and is concerned with modeling the price of houses in those suburbs in thousands of dollars. As such, this is a regression predictive modeling problem. Input attributes include things like crime rate, proportion of nonretail business acres, chemical concentrations and more. It is convenient to work with because all of the input and output attributes are numerical and there are 506 instances to work with.\n",

No activation function is used for the output layer because it is a regression problem and we are interested in predicting numerical values directly without transform.\n",
