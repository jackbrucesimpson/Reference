    "# Keras Multi-Class Classification on Iris Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is well studied and is a good problem for practicing on neural networks because all of the 4 input variables are numeric and have the same scale in centimeters. Each instance describes the properties of an observed flower measurements and the output variable is specific iris species.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a multi-class classification problem, meaning that there are more than two classes to be predicted, in fact there are three flower species. This is an important type of problem on which to practice with neural networks because the three class values require specialized handling. The iris flower dataset is a well studied problem and a such we can expect to achieve an model accuracy in the range of 95% to 97%. This provides a good target to aim for when developing our models.\n"

    "## Encode The Output Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "The output variable contains three different string values. When modeling multi-class classification problems using neural networks, it is good practice to reshape the output attribute from a vector that contains values for each class value to be a matrix with a boolean for each class value and whether or not a given instance has that class value or not. This is called one hot encoding or creating dummy variables from a categorical variable. For example, in this problem three class values are Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor and Iris-virginica.\n",

    "The hidden layer uses a rectifier activation function which is a good practice. Because we used a one-hot encoding for our iris dataset, the output layer must create 3 output values, one for each class. The output value with the largest value will be taken as the class predicted by the model.\n",

    "Note that we use a sigmoid activation function in the output layer. This is to ensure the output values are in the range of 0 and 1 and may be used as predicted probabilities.\n",
